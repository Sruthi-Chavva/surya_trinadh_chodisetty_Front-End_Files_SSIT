    <p>Infrastructure: This college doesn't allow mobile, so there is no need for Wi-Fi. Labs will be there with a continuous LAN connection. The hostels will be there; outside the college, food is not that great; canteen food is good, but the price is high. Sports and games are allowed once a week.</p>

    <p>Faculty: 20 percent of the faculty are very good, but the rest are below par because they are explaining through ppts all the time, so we can't get more knowledge and interest about the topic. For every 5 months of semester exams that will happen, exam difficulty is not that tough .</p>
